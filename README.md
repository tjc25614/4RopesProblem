# 4RopesProblem
Simulation by Thomas Conroy
As mentioned on FiveThirtyEight: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/two-mysteries-of-the-gold-coins/

This program (extremely inefficiently) brute forces a solution to the 4 Ropes Riddler Classic (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-riddle-how-many-crooked-politicians-are-there/). It could be made to run much, much faster and more accurately with a little effort, but it worked and gave the correct answer of 23.
